## Project Overview

During my summer research at UIUC's Verifier Development Group, I worked with [Prof. Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com/) on critical improvements to machine learning verification benchmarks, focusing on the alpha-beta-CROWN verification system and addressing reproducibility challenges in the field.

## Key Contributions

### Numerical Stability and Tolerance
- **Set rigorous thresholds** for absolute and relative tolerance through systematic parameter sweeps
- **Implemented stability checks** to ensure consistent verification results across different environments
- **Addressed precision issues** that were causing inconsistent results in competition settings

### Reproducibility Improvements
- **Investigated numerical mismatches** in critical benchmarks (e.g., vnncomp23/ml4acopf)
- **Proposed and implemented fixes** for reproducibility issues across different hardware/software configurations
- **Developed standardized protocols** for verification result validation

### Competition Infrastructure
- **Streamlined log parsing** to extract relevant verification metrics efficiently
- **Enhanced reporting systems** for competition preparation and performance tracking
- **Improved experiment traceability** through better documentation and logging practices

## Technical Challenges Addressed

### Numerical Precision
- Floating-point arithmetic inconsistencies across platforms
