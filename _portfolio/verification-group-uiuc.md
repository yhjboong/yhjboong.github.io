## Project Overview

During my summer research at UIUC's Verifier Development Group, I worked with [Prof. Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com/) on critical improvements to machine learning verification benchmarks, focusing on the alpha-beta-CROWN verification system and addressing reproducibility challenges that were hindering reliable verification competitions and research reproducibility.

## Key Contributions

- **Set rigorous thresholds** for absolute and relative tolerance through systematic parameter sweeps
- **Implemented stability checks** to ensure consistent verification results across different computational environments
- **Addressed precision issues** that were causing inconsistent results in competition settings
- **Investigated numerical mismatches** in critical benchmarks (e.g., vnncomp23/ml4acopf)
- **Proposed and implemented fixes** for reproducibility issues across different hardware/software configurations
- **Developed standardized protocols** for verification result validation and comparison
- **Streamlined log parsing** to extract relevant verification metrics efficiently
- **Enhanced reporting systems** for competition preparation and performance tracking
- **Improved experiment traceability** through better documentation and logging practices

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Numerical analysis** and floating-point arithmetic optimization for verification systems
- **Python programming** for analysis and automation script development
- **Bash scripting** for complex workflow automation and pipeline management
- **Statistical analysis** for threshold optimization and parameter tuning
- **Performance profiling** and optimization techniques for large-scale verification
- **Cross-platform compatibility** testing and debugging across diverse computational environments
- **Alpha-beta-CROWN verification system** expertise and advanced usage
- **Competition infrastructure** development and maintenance

## Impact and Applications

This work directly contributed to improving verification research infrastructure with applications in:
- **Safety-critical AI systems** requiring formal verification guarantees
- **Autonomous vehicles** and robotics systems with safety requirements
- **Medical AI applications** where verification is essential for regulatory approval
- **Financial systems** requiring provable correctness and robustness
- **Competition benchmarking** for fair and reproducible verification research
- **Research reproducibility** across the broader ML verification community

## Research Significance

Machine learning verification is critical for deploying AI systems in safety-critical applications. This work addresses fundamental infrastructure challenges that enable the broader verification community to conduct more reliable and reproducible research, ultimately contributing to safer AI deployment in real-world applications. The improvements to numerical stability and benchmark standardization have lasting impact on the field's ability to conduct rigorous verification research.
