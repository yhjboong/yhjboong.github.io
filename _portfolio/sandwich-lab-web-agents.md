## Project Overview

At the SaNDwich Lab, a collaboration between IBM and the University of Notre Dame, I'm working under [Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) to revolutionize how we evaluate web agents. Rather than simple success/failure metrics, we're developing trajectory-level evaluation that assesses the quality and value alignment of entire action sequences in web automation tasks.

## Key Contributions

- **Developed trajectory-level evaluation framework** for scoring action sequences, not only end success
- **Created controlled replica testbeds** for retail, maps, and flight booking scenarios to avoid anti-bot drift
- **Implemented standardized browser automation** using browser-use framework (screenshots + DOM)
- **Encoded user values** (e.g., vegan, budget-conscious) and logged value reasoning separately from action reasoning
- **Added completion-page checks** to prevent false continuation and improve evaluation accuracy
- **Instrumented various factors** including API vs. end-to-end performance analysis
- **Analyzed environmental variables** such as recommender settings, pricing frames, and deceptive ads

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Browser automation** using screenshots and DOM manipulation frameworks
- **Controlled environment replication** for major web platforms and services
- **Value encoding systems** and preference tracking for ethical AI evaluation
- **Comprehensive logging** and analysis pipelines for complex behavioral data
- **Multi-factor experimental design** for robust evaluation methodology
- **Human-AI interaction** principles and evaluation framework development

## Impact and Applications

This framework enables more sophisticated evaluation of web agents across various domains and has practical applications in:
- **E-commerce platforms** with budget and preference constraints
- **Travel booking systems** with personal preferences and accessibility requirements
- **Navigation systems** with user-specific needs and restrictions
- **General web automation** with ethical considerations and value alignment
- **Human-AI collaboration** assessment in real-world scenarios

## Publication Status

This work is being prepared for submission to IUI, where it will contribute to advancing the field of human-AI interaction and web automation evaluation methodologies.
