  location: "Notre Dame, IN"
  position: "Undergraduate Researcher"
  advisor: "Prof. Xiangliang Zhang"
  period: "Sep 2024 -- Present"
  projects:
    - "Prepared co-first-author (equal contribution) manuscript under submission demonstrating that sentence-level hidden-state interventions substantially improve reflective reasoning (ΔR) while minimally affecting transition and execution behaviors (ΔT,ΔE)."
    - "Separated behavior from semantics by constructing a meaning-removed control vector v_r^- via position-matched rephrasing; performed causal injections/ablations across layers and validated with cosine-similarity structure and nearest-neighbor analyses."
    - "Released reproducible tooling for vector extraction, a re-sampling stability filter to drop mixed-behavior positions, and layer-wise ablations; additionally authored ML primers and developed the tutorial section for the NSF C2D project (Award #2321054)."

- lab: "SaNDwich Lab (IBM–Notre Dame collaboration)"
  institution: "University of Notre Dame"
  location: "Notre Dame, IN"
  position: "Undergraduate Researcher"
  advisor: "Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li"
  period: "Aug 2025 -- Present"
  projects:
    - "Co-authored trajectory-level evaluation for web agents (scoring action sequences, not only end success); manuscript in preparation for IUI 2026."
    - "Created controlled replica testbeds (retail, maps, flights) with standardized browser automation (browser-use: screenshots+DOM) to avoid anti-bot drift and enable reproducible evaluations."
    - "Encoded user values (e.g., vegan, budget-conscious) and logged value reasoning separately from action reasoning; added completion-page checks to stop false continuation and instrumented factors (API vs. end-to-end, recommender on/off, pricing frames, deceptive ads)."

  institution: "University of Michigan"
  location: "Remote / Ann Arbor, MI"
  position: "Undergraduate Researcher"
  advisor: "Prof. Qiaozhu Mei"
  period: "May 2025 -- Present"
  projects:
    - "Harmonized LiveBench, HELM, and LMSYS Arena (standardized model IDs, deduplicated variants, retained latest per model–objective) to enable principled cross-benchmark comparison."
    - "Constructed model similarity maps with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and centrality; reported fit metrics (raw stress, Stress-1) and verified stability under injected noise and sub-sampling."
    - "Diagnosed sources of misalignment and proposed compact task subsets that preserve the similarity structure while reducing evaluation cost."

  period: "May 2025 -- Aug 2025"
  projects:
    - "Set absolute/relative tolerance thresholds via parameter sweeps and stability checks for ML verification benchmarks."
    - "Investigated numerical mismatches (e.g., vnncomp23/ml4acopf), proposed fixes, and improved reproducibility."
    - "Streamlined log parsing and reporting to accelerate competition preparation and experiment traceability."

    - "Analyzed 79 mutations and reviewed 39 additional cases to study error propagation and refine evaluation methodology."
    - "Labeled 99 mutations and contributed 52 dataset improvements to strengthen taxonomy and formatting consistency."
