**Status**: In preparation (co-author)

**Abstract**: This work presents a novel framework for evaluating web agents that moves beyond binary success/failure metrics to assess the quality of action sequences and alignment with user values. We introduce trajectory-level evaluation methodologies and demonstrate their effectiveness across multiple web automation scenarios.

**Key Contributions**:
- Co-authored trajectory-level evaluation framework for web agents (scoring action sequences, not only end success)
- Created controlled replica testbeds (retail, maps, flights) with standardized browser automation (browser-use: screenshots+DOM)
- Encoded user values (e.g., vegan, budget-conscious) and logged value reasoning separately from action reasoning
- Added completion-page checks and instrumented various factors (API vs. end-to-end, recommender settings, pricing frames, deceptive ads)

**Impact**: This framework enables more nuanced evaluation of web agents, considering not just whether they complete tasks but how well they align with user preferences and values throughout the interaction process.
