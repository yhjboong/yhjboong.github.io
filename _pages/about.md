I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) (expected graduation May 2026) with a strong focus on **LLM reasoning and verification**. My research spans across hallucination remediation, evaluation methodology, human-AI collaboration, and dataset quality assessment.

Currently, I'm conducting research across multiple prestigious institutions:
- **MINE Lab (Notre Dame)** - Working on meaning-removed steering vectors for calibrating LLM reasoning
- **SaNDwich Lab (IBMâ€“Notre Dame)** - Developing trajectory-level evaluation for web agents with value alignment
- **FORESEER Lab (University of Michigan)** - Harmonizing evaluation benchmarks and analyzing model similarities

My work combines theoretical foundations with practical applications, contributing to research manuscripts currently under submission.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on **LLM reasoning and verification**, specifically:

1. **Hallucination remediation and interpretability** - Developing methods to identify and correct false information in large language models
2. **Evaluation methodology across benchmarks** - Ensuring validity, reliability, and robustness in AI evaluation systems
3. **Human-computer interaction (HCI)** - Designing effective evaluation systems and fostering Human-AI collaboration
4. **Dataset quality, measurement and value alignment** - Improving the foundation of AI training and evaluation data

Recent Work
======
I'm currently working on several cutting-edge projects:

- **Meaning-Removed Steering Vectors** (MINE Lab): Developing novel techniques for calibrating LLM reasoning through sentence-level hidden-state interventions
- **Web Agent Evaluation** (SaNDwich Lab): Creating trajectory-level evaluation systems that go beyond simple success metrics to assess value alignment
- **Benchmark Harmonization** (FORESEER Lab): Standardizing and improving cross-benchmark comparisons in AI evaluation
